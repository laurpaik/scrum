# Scrum

## Prerequisites

-   None.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Have a productive stand up
-   Define what is meant by 'Agile'

## Reading

Spend about 15 minutes on your own reading the following:

-  [Scrum - Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum)
  - Scrum --> subset of AGILE (software development methodologies)
  - Scrum has four ceremonies that bring structure to a sprint:
    - Sprint planning
      - Team planning meeting, talk about #goals
      - Discuss each item in the product backlog
    - Daily Stand-up
      - aka daily scrum
      - 15 minute power meeting to sync up the team
    - Sprint demo
      - Sharing meeting where your team shows their work
    - Sprint retrospective
      - Review of what did/didn't go well to make the next one better
  - Sounds a lot like what I imagine the consultants are doing after training!
  - Three roles in a scrum team:
    - Product Owner
      - Business side of stuff
      - Partner with the business/team to make sure everyone knows what's up in the product backlog
      - goal maker
      - approves when products get shipped
      - Antony?
    - Scrum Master
      - Team coach!
      - Jeff!
      - Resolve distractions
      - Keeps everyone within scope
    - Development Team
      - Mike, Rachel, Ben, Bernard
      - #teamwork
      - drives the plan for each sprint
      - predict what they can accomplish
-  [Agile Ceremonies](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/ceremonies)
  - Look in the ceremony area above
-  [How to Do Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/how-to-do-scrum-with-jira-software)

## Squad Discussion

After reading the above, take 5-10 minutes to work with your squads and answer
the following:

1.  What is a scrum master?
1.  What are sprints?
  2. Fixed length iterations
  3. End of a sprint is a milestone :)
1.  What is the purpose of a stand up?

## Exercise: Stand Up

Let's practice!

1.  What did you accomplish yesterday?
1.  What are your goals for today?
1.  Is anything blocking you from moving forward today?
